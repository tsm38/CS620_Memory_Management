My program works well, but I was not able to complete the part with compacction. Either I tried to do it and everything broke, or I implement nothing and it works fine. I think the problem is when I try to insert the node for the hole, It defults to go to the end of the list, instead of where it needs to be, so therefore, the hole is difficult to use if it is in the wrong placeOriginally, my work around for that was just to print it differentlyit worked at first,, but once I tried to do more complex things, it broke.
